    <p><strong>WARNING!</strong> Use at your own risk. BG1 is highly experimental, for demonstration purposes only, and provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. It is in no way endorsed by or associated with the Walt Disney Company and could stop working at any time for any reason. To ensure the intended experience, always use the official Disney app.</p>
  </aside>

  <h2>What is BG1?</h2>

  <p>BG1 is an unofficial, experimental client for obtaining Genie+ Lightning Lane reservations and virtual queue boarding groups at Disney theme parks in the United States.</p>

  <p>The code is open source and <a href="https://github.com/joelface/bg1">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>

  <p>I originally created BG1 to demonstrate how the virtual queue interface in the Walt Disney World app could be tweaked to provide guests with a less frustrating user experience. Many of these improvements were eventually incorporated into the WDW and Disneyland apps. Since then, I've updated BG1 to bring a similarly streamlined experience to the Genie+ service.</p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>

  <p>BG1 is made possible in part by an ancient Web browser feature called bookmarklets. A bookmarklet is a special kind of bookmark that, instead of loading a new page, runs some JavaScript code on the page you're already on. The BG1 bookmarklet, when run on the appropriate page, is able to make the same network requests that the Disney apps make when attempting to join a boarding group or make Lightning Lane reservations.</p>

  <h2>How can I try it?</h2>

  <p>First, reread the disclaimer at the top of the page. If you still insist on testing it out, here's how:</p>

  <h3 id="add-bookmarklet">Adding the bookmarklet to your browser</h3>

  <p>Mobile browsers have terrible support for adding bookmarklets, but I've tried to make it as simple as possible:</p>

  <div class="buttons"><a href="setup.html">BG1 Setup Guide</a></div>

  <h3 id="use-bookmarklet">Using the bookmarklet</h3>

  <p>BG1 is supported on the default Web browsers on both iPhone (Safari) and Android (Chrome). The process for loading BG1 is a little different on each:</p>

  <h4>iPhone (Safari browser)</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the BG1 bookmarklet, which will load the <a href="start.html">BG1 Start</a> page.</li>
    <li>Select the service you want to use.</li>
    <li>The page that loads will just have some code on it. To load the BG1 interface, run the BG1 bookmarklet again.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Android (Chrome browser)</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <a href="start.html">BG1 Start</a> page that you bookmarked during setup.</li>
    <li>Select the service you want to use.</li>
    <li>The page that loads will just have some code on it. To load the BG1 interface, type <kbd>BG1</kbd> into the browser's address/search bar and then tap <samp>BG1 Bookmarklet</samp> in the suggestions list.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Questions of Varying Frequency</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Why is it not working? All I see is a page of "code".</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>As I mentioned in the <a href="#use-bookmarklet">instructions for using the bookmarklet</a>, tapping a button on the <a href="start.html">BG1 Start</a> page doesn't load BG1 on its own. It just takes you to the page you need to be on for the bookmarklet to work. The BG1 interface will only appear after you've run the bookmarklet on the "code" page.</p>
      <p>If it still isn't working, go into your Web browser's settings and delete the browsing data/cache. This option is usually listed under the Privacy/Security category. If that doesn't help, delete the bookmarklet and carefully follow the <a href="#add-bookmarklet">BG1 Setup Guide</a> guide again.</p>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why does BG1 make me sign into my Disney account?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>To be able to make the authenticated requests required to join a boarding group, BG1 needs an access token obtained by signing into your Disney account. This access token, which is only valid for a 24 hour period, is the only piece of data stored (locally in your browser) as a result of the login process.</p>
      <p>You'll receive an automated email from Disney every time you sign in, just like when you log into the Disney app or website on a new device.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why not a mobile app? Wouldn't you be able to make this easier to use?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Sure, but this isn't intended for widespread use (or any use at all, really). BG1 is simply a personal experiment that I made public in the hope that some of its ideas might eventually make their way into the official app.</p>
