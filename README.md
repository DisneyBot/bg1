# BG1: An Unofficial, Experimental Boarding Group Client

**WARNING! Use at your own risk. BG1 is highly experimental, for demonstration purposes only, and provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. It could stop working at any time for any reason. There is no guarantee that using BG1 will actually help you obtain a boarding group, and it should not be relied on for this or any other purpose. Always use the official Disney app.**

Read the [BG1 documentation](https://joelface.github.io/bg1/) to learn more.

**UPDATE:** As of September 9, 2021, the My Disney Experience app has been updated to include many of the virtual queue user experience improvements first implemented in BG1. (Hat tip to Len Testa of [Touring Plans](https://touringplans.com/).)
