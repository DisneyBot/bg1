  <h1>About BG1</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <p>Hi, I'm Joel! I've been a Disney theme park fan since my very first trip to Walt Disney World as a kid. When I'm not watching a WDW or Disneyland live stream, there's a good chance I'm listening to classic EPCOT background area music.</p>

  <p>I created BG1 after reading endless complaints online from people who lost out on a chance to ride the groundbreaking new Rise of the Resistance attraction because of seemingly random technical issues with Disney's app. Many of the enhancements introduced by BG1 were later implemented in the official apps, creating a less frustrating experience for the millions of guests who visit Disney's parks every year.</p>

  <p>Since then, I've updated BG1 to help guests get the most out of the Genie+ service, with a more user-friendly, streamlined interface for finding and booking the best Lightning Lanes.</p>
